/* The world is swimming in data and with so many sources everywhere, it's often on you to tie them together.
Most data tools need to read from a single data so will use Unions, Joins and Logical Relationship models to tie them together.
In this week's challenge we will introduce you to joining data sets together to prepare them for analysis. 

This week's challenge is to link together a Quarterly Sales Target data source (an Excel Workbook) with our original sales data (Week One output). Is Prep Air meeting its targets? */
